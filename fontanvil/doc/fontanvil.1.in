.SH DESCRIPTION
FontAnvil is a script language interpreter that automates
editing and conversion of font files, especially in the context of the
Tsukurimashou Project.
It descends from a GUI program called FontForge (originally named
PfaEdit).
FontForge includes a \(lqnative\(rq scripting language and also an embedded
Python interpreter, but is primarily focused on interactive GUI use,
and its huge footprint and wide-ranging dependencies make it unsuitable for
applications such as font package build infrastructure.
FontAnvil is a standalone interpreter of the \(lqnative\(rq scripting
language (here called \(lqPE script\(rq for neutrality) with some bug fixes
and enhancements beyond FontForge's implementation, suitable for automated
and command-line environments.
.PP
FontAnvil retains general, but not complete, compatibility with FontForge
and should be able to execute well-written FontForge scripts without
modification.
.PP
If given a script to execute (either by a filename specified on the command
line, or the
.B \-c
option), FontAnvil will execute the commands in the
script and then terminate.
Otherwise, it will enter an interactive command-line mode where it
accepts commands and executes them immediately, with readline support
if possible, until it encounters an end-of-file, termination command, or
fatal error.
.
.SH OPTIONS
Long options may be specified with single hyphens as in
.B \-option
or with double hyphens as
.BR \-\^\-option ;
use of single hyphen is required for single-character options.
It is against modern Unix conventions to use single hyphen for long options,
but single hyphen may be preferable here nonetheless, for compatibility with
FontForge's non-standard option parsers.
Similarly, FontAnvil will accept use of an equal sign for specifying the
argument to a long option, but FontForge may not consistently accept it,
so this usage may be better avoided.
.TP
.BI \-c " CMD\fR, \fP " "\-command " CMD
Execute a literal PE script command from the command line.
FontAnvil will not look for a script file name on the command line if this
option is used; all arguments starting with the first non-option argument
will become arguments passed to the script.
Note this option may only be used once (the last instance taking precedence
over any others); unlike the behaviour of such
interpreters as Perl, a multi-line script cannot be specified with several
command-line options.
.TP
.B "\-d\fR, \fP \-dry"
Activate a \(lqdry run mode\(rq inherited from the legacy FontForge
interpreter.
It appears to be intended for syntax checking.
It causes
.IR most ,
but not
.IR all ,
commands in the script to be skipped.
Use of this option is not recommended, and its effects or
continued existence in future versions are not guaranteed.
.TP
.B "\-h\fR, \fP\-help\fR, \fP-usage"
Display a help message about command-line usage, and terminate without
executing a script.
.TP
.B "\-l ff\fR, \fP\-lang ff"
Specify the interpreter language, which for FontAnvil should
always be
.BR ff .
That value is ignored for FontForge compatibility;
any other value is a fatal error.
.TP
.B "\-q\fR, \fP-quiet"
Reduce the verbosity of error, warning, and informational messages sent to
standard error.
This option may be specified more than once to reduce the messages even
further from the default level.
.TP
.B "\-V\fR, \fP-verbose"
Increase the verbosity of error, warning, and informational messages sent to
standard error.
This option may be specified more than once to increase the messages even
further from the default level.
.TP
.B "\-v\fR, \fP-version"
Display a version and copyright banner, and terminate without executing a
script.
.TP
.B "\-i\fR, \fP-nosplash\fR, \fP-script"
Options ignored for compatibility.
For maximum likelihood that a command line will be parsed correctly by
.I both
FontAnvil and FontForge, specify
.B \-script
as the last option argument and then the script filename as the
next argument.
.TP
.B "\-\^\-"
Terminate option scanning.
All subsequent arguments will be processed as \(lqnon-option\(rq
arguments, either script filenames or arguments passed to the script,
even if they otherwise resemble option syntax.
This allows, for instance, execution of a script whose filename
is literally the string \(lq-script\(rq.
