FontAnvil has a typical non-recursive Autotools build system.
More detailed instructions are in the PDF documentation in the doc/
subdirectory; quick start instructions below, but the procedure
should already be familiar to almost anyone who has a reason to
use this software.

If something fails, the scripts will usually tell you why.

IF YOU ARE COMPILING FROM AN UNPACKED TARBALL DISTRIBUTION:

./configure
make
# as root:
make install

IF YOU ARE COMPILING FROM A VERSION CONTROL CHECKOUT:

Icemap is a required dependency for building from version control (only);
it generates source files that would be included ready-made in a tarball.
You must have Icemap to build from a version control checkout.  Other
dependencies specific to version control checkouts include Autotools
and Flex, for similar reasons.  There are also some files of Unicode
character data that will need to be downloaded.

autoreconf -i
./configure
# this step will connect to the Net
make download
make
# as root, or at least enough privilege to write to where you're installing:
make install
