This copy of the Tsukurimashou source code is being checked into Github to
increase its visibility, and I will try to keep it up to date, but the
official location for Tsukurimashou development is on Sourceforge.JP:

   http://osdn.jp/projects/tsukurimashou/

Submit all bug reports, support requests, patches, and other items related
to Tsukurimashou development through Sourceforge.JP, not through Github.

QUICK START FROM SOURCE CONTROL CHECKOUT

autoreconf -i
./configure
make download
make

This requires an Internet connection and will use it to download
character databases.
