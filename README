It is not planned for there to be further updates to this Github-based copy
of Tsukurimashou.  The main home for Tsukurimashou development is here:

   http://osdn.jp/projects/tsukurimashou/

Submit all bug reports, support requests, patches, and other items related
to Tsukurimashou development through OSDN, not through Github.
